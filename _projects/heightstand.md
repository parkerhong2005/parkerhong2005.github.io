how_text: "Lots of low-fidelity mockups utilizing recycled parts from the Shop, and testing concepts even if we weren't one hundred percent sure how they worked. For example, our 'pulley' system, made from PLA spools, rope, and sandpaper, may not have been the most traditional setup but it worked well enough to test."

why_text: "College students everywhere loft their dorm room beds. While this is an excellent method for making space, it almost always comes at the loss of a typical nightstand experience. The classic bedside table for your phone, water, glasses, and whatever else you may need at night is no longer an option. Plus, you'll need those things when you're out of bed too. The Heightstand offers the perfect solution, allowing users access to their items regardless of their elevation. Complete with a basket and outlet at the top, the heightstand can be adjusted to be a nightstand when you need it to be, and a quick and easy transport system when you're back on the ground."
