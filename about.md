    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Born and raised in Chicago, Illinois, I have been surrounded by the world's best engineering and design all my life. From (LEGO) bricks to buildings to boats, I love to know and see how all the individual pieces work together in the context of a finished, functional product. Whether it's parts, people, or puzzle pieces, I seek to use my skills in design and organization to create something even greater than their sum. <br> <br>
      In addition to the diverse and multidisciplinary MaDE curriculum, I am currently developing my design and rapid prototyping skills through my project workâ€“ working with the Northwestern Formula Racing team, Evanston Township High School, and Northwestern's very own Segal Design Institute.
      <br> <br>
      Outside of the classroom, I enjoy rowing for Northwestern Crew, of which currently serve as the Men's Varsity Captain. Even in my 9th year of rowing, I am still finding constant ways to improve my technique and optimize my fitness. It has also been a joy to give back to such an impactful sport through my coaching positions at ETHS and the Chicago Rowing Foundation, where I first learned to row.
