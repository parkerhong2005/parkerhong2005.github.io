![Parker Hong](images/profile.jpg){:width="200px" style="border-radius: 50%"}

Hi! I'm Parker Hong, a junior studying Manufacturing and Design Engineering at Northwestern University. I am also pursuing a minor in Architectural Engineering and Design as well as working on some independent design projects this fall.

When I'm not engineering, I am rowing, biking, doing my RA duties, or solving puzzles.
