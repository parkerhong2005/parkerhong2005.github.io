    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    Born and raised in Chicago, Illinois, I’ve been immersed in the world of engineering and design from an early age. From LEGO bricks to buildings to boats, I’ve always been fascinated by how individual pieces come together to form a functional whole. Whether it’s parts, people, or puzzle pieces, I aim to leverage my skills in design and organization to create solutions that are greater than the sum of their parts.
    <br> <br>
    Through the multidisciplinary MaDE curriculum, I’m honing my design and rapid prototyping abilities, applying them to hands-on projects with the Northwestern Formula Racing team, Evanston Township High School, and Northwestern’s Segal Design Institute. These experiences have given me a unique perspective on collaborative problem-solving and iterative design.
    <br> <br>
    Outside the classroom, I row for Northwestern Crew, where I currently serve as Men’s Varsity Captain. Even in my ninth year of rowing, I’m constantly refining my technique and pushing my limits. Coaching at ETHS and the Chicago Rowing Foundation— where I first discovered the sport— has been equally rewarding, allowing me to give back to a community that shaped me.
